Shape is meant to run in review. In application repos, install a pinned `shp` release and run the checker directly.

![PR change review workflow showing shape system files, shape changes, changed files, coverage, shp check, and CI result.](../../../assets/infographics/pr-change-review.png)

## Recommended workflow

```yaml
name: Shape

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  shape:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: timbrinded/shapelang@v0.1.0
      - run: shp check
      - run: shp fmt --check
```

## Coverage gate

Coverage checks compare changed source paths with implementation blocks:

```yaml
- name: Changed files
  run: git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD > changed.txt

- name: Shape coverage
  run: shp coverage --changed-files changed.txt
```

If a governed source path changes without a shape delta or attestation, the checker rejects the change.

## Shape repo workflow

The Shape repository dogfoods this workflow more strictly than a normal consumer repo. CI generates `changed.txt`, then runs formatting, semantic checks, coverage, obligations, and memory output:

```bash
bun run changed-files
bun run shape:ci
```

`shape:ci` runs `bun shp check --changed-files changed.txt`, so implementation coverage and bindings are checked together. Bindings are used for documentation coupling: if Shape-affecting code or model files change, the associated docs must change too, unless the PR includes a narrow `docs_not_needed` attestation.

## Direct binary install

If you do not want to use the setup action, use the release installer directly:

```yaml
- name: Install shp
  run: |
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/timbrinded/shapelang/releases/download/v0.1.0/install.sh | sh
```

## Shape repo checks

The Shape repository itself also runs Bun workspace tests, typechecking, docs verification, and release smoke tests. Those are contributor checks, not required for application repos that only consume `shp`.

See [Local Development](../reference/local-development) for the contributor commands.
